# Springboard Projects 🚀

Welcome to my Springboard Data Engineering Bootcamp project repository. This is a meta-repo that tracks and links out to all individual projects completed during the program.

Each project is stored in its own GitHub repo and includes Python code, SQL scripts, ETL workflows, and documentation.
