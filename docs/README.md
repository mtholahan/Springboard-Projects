# 📁 Project Docs & Rubrics

This folder contains supporting materials and documentation related to my Springboard Data Engineering Bootcamp projects.

## Contents

- 🧾 **Rubrics** – Project requirements and evaluation criteria from Springboard  
- 🧱 **Diagrams** – Data models, ERDs, and architecture flows  
- 📄 **Planning Notes** – Notes from project scoping, design, or debugging  
- 📊 **Results** – Final outputs, metrics, and visualizations from select projects

Each file is named to match its related project. Feel free to explore for deeper context on how and why each project was implemented.

💡 *Use this folder if you're a recruiter, reviewer, or instructor looking for more than just the code.*
